There are 138 distinct fees in the data set, which makes understanding the patterns and sources of these extra shipping fees difficult to track.
We are building a tool which the company is interested in implementing to solve this issue. By creating a Charge Code Index using test extraction, cluster analysis, and domain knowledge, 
we are creating a system of meaningful relationships between individual fees that will allow practinioners to categorize and monitor these charges.
